# Skyrim Master Server

This server is intended for not-for-profit use only. This program will completely manage all aspects of your Skyrim Together server environment.

This includes:
- Server creation,
- Server starting/stopping,
- Server auto restarting on crash.

This utilises MySQL and as such can be used with a web-based panel.

# Previous Builds

Previously, I used a config-based approach. You can find a fully working binary for that version (0.2) in the releases. The current build is a work in progress and is not ready to be used. If you want a fully working solution now, use release version 0.2.
